Murano
======
Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application
developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready
applications in a browsable‎ categorised catalog, which may be used by the
cloud users (including the inexperienced ones) to pick-up the needed
applications and services and composes the reliable environments out of them
in a “push-the-button” manner.
