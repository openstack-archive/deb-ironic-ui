features:
  - Version of Dynamic UI is increased to 2.3 due to *password* field update.
    Now *password* supports validator overloading and control of automatic
    password conformation field insertion.

    * If ``regexpValidator`` is provided, default complex check for numbers,
      capital and small letters in the password is not performed. Also, several
      validators with corresponding Dynamic UI field may be used.

    * ``confirmInput`` parameter is supported now for controlling whether
      password field should be cloned or not.
      If application author decided to turn off automatic field cloning, he
      should set the new parameter to *false*.
