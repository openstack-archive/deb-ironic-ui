  - cve-2016-4972 has been addressed. In ceveral places
    Murano used loaders inherited directly from yaml.Loader
    when parsing MuranoPL and UI files from packages.
    This is unsafe, because this loader is capable of creating
    custom python objects from specifically constructed
    yaml files. With this change all yaml loading operations are done
    using safe loaders instead.
