    This release adds support for adding and deleting
    nodes. Support has also been added for adding and
    deleting ports. The panel will now be hidden if the
    baremetal service is not present in the scenario where
    the collection of running services differs between
    multiple keystone regions.
features:
  - Add and delete nodes
  - Add and delete ports
  - Panel hidden if baremetal service or admin rights are not present
  - UX improvements across the interface
  - Breadcrumbs have been added
issues:
  - Currently it is not possible to edit a node via the UI
    once it has been enrolled. Therefore, the enrollment must
    be done accurately to ensure the node is enrolled accurately
    and can then be made available. At present, any errors
    made during enrollment can only be corrected by deleting
    the node and enrolling it again.
